Nodejs Twitch Bot for Beginners

### Installation & Prerequisites
Simply clone the repository, enter the directory via Terminal/Command Line, and type `npm init`. Afterwards, create a Twitch account for your bot and visit https://twitchapps.com/tmi/ to generate an Oauth token. This token will be required to connect your bot to Twitch IRC. With your bot's newly-generated credentials, update app.js to reflect these changes. I've outlined the areas where this is to be done.

### Running the bot
While in the bot's directory, simply type `node app.js`.
